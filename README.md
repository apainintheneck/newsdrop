# Newsdrop
Newsdrop is an article submission website like Reddit that was built by Jeannie Davis, Bryce Randolph, Kevin Robell, and Harsandeep Singh for a class project at CSUMB. It was built using Bootstrap and JQuery for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. You can view the website deployed to Heroku [here](https://news-drop.herokuapp.com/).
